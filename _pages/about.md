I'm in the groove with software development at the University of Utah and set to graduate in December 2024. I'm on the hunt for a full-stack development or cybersecurity internship and stoked to dive into the tech world headfirst.

With a B.S. in Biological Science, which have granted me a unique lens to view and understand the world, enriching my approach to tech solutions.

A bit more about me:

🎯 I'm a goal-driven person (MBTI:ISTP)

🍳 I like Asian food and creating new recipes

📸 Photography: I like portrait photography and nature scenery 

📚 The Courage to Be Disliked

📺 Friends

🎶Coldplay, Taylor Swift

🎬 Soul, Little Woman

🤝 Let's connect and make tech even more awesome!
